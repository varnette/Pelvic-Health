### Abstract  
This case report, which **earned Virginia Arnette the Outstanding Capstone Award** in her graduating class at the University of Colorado Denverâ€™s Doctorate of Physical Therapy program, describes the management of a 38-year-old woman with Stage II Pelvic Organ Prolapse (POP) and Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI), who had limited access to care. Given the constraints of only two therapy sessions over two weeks, the focus was on patient education and a self-management program. The patient was taught neuromuscular re-education techniques and therapeutic exercises targeting weak pelvic floor muscles and provided with strategies for behavioral modification to manage symptoms independently post-treatment. After 30 days, the patient reported a significant reduction in POP symptoms and SUI events, with a 36.5-point improvement in the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory score.

### Background  
POP affects about 50% of women who have given birth and is often accompanied by SUI, a condition where urine is involuntarily lost during physical exertion. While the physical therapy management of POP and SUI is supported by evidence, access to specialized care can be limited. This award-winning report aims to illustrate how effective self-management and education strategies can be for patients with restricted access to physical therapy.

### Case Description  
The patient, a 38-year-old woman, presented with weak pelvic floor musculature, impaired activation sequencing, and a history of lumbar radiculopathy, contributing to her POP and SUI symptoms. She had limited contact hours with a physical therapist due to insurance constraints and opted for treatment from a student therapist. Examination revealed deficits in pelvic floor strength, neuromuscular coordination, and significant negative self-body image, impacting her daily activities and quality of life.

### Intervention  
The intervention included neuromuscular re-education of the pelvic floor and abdominal stabilizers, strengthening exercises, and comprehensive education on behavioral modification strategies to mitigate POP and SUI symptoms. Given the limited contact hours, the emphasis was on training the patient to continue these exercises independently.

### Outcomes  
After 30 days, the patient reported a significant improvement in POP and SUI symptoms, as evidenced by a 36.5-point decrease in her Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory score. The patient demonstrated a reduction in urinary incontinence episodes and articulated behavioral strategies to manage POP symptoms, despite limited therapy sessions.

### Discussion  
This case underscores that even with limited physical therapy contact hours, significant improvement in POP and SUI symptoms is possible through targeted education and self-management strategies. Future research should explore the efficacy of home-use biofeedback devices and compare different exercise protocols to optimize outcomes for patients with limited access to care.
